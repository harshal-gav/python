mylist[:]

The colon (:) inside the brackets indicates that you are taking a slice of the entire list from the beginning to the end.

It effectively means "give me everything from the start to the end of the list."

mylist[::]
The double colon (::) introduces a step parameter to the slice.
The format for slicing is start:stop:step. 
In this case, you haven't specified start or stop, but you've set the step to its default value of 1.
Thus, mylist[::] also means "give me everything from the start to the end of the list, with a step of 1."

e.g.
mylist = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

print(mylist[::2])  
# Output: [10, 30, 50] (every second element)
This shows how :: can be used for more complex slicing.
