1) define a class Sample with
	data as instance member
	init which takes one parameter in order to initialize "data"

make sure following things are possible

s1=Sample(7)
s2=Sample(5)
s3=Sample(8)
s4=Sample(12)

s5=s4-s1+s3*s2

print(s5)   #  ans should be  45

2) define a class MyClass with
	x as instance member
