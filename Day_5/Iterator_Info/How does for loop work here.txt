how does "for i in ref1:" work here?

it first invokes "__iter__()" method of MyNumber class.

	__iter__() method returns for loop the object of "MyNumber"

now for loop invokes "__next__()" method of MyNumber class which returns a number every time.
This number for loop stores inside "i" variable and then prints.
when the value goes beyond 10, for loop stops as it gets "Stop Iteration" from the "next" function.
